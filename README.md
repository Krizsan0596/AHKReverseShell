# AHKReverseShell
I wrote this script a while back and it still works just fine so I thought I would upload it.
So all the script does is open CMD, do some *dark magic*, and connect to a device. 
Only requirement: ***The machine needs Ncat installed***. You can get it [here](https://nmap.org/ncat/).
